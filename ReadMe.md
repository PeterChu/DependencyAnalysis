## How to run
- Clone the project
- Open the program folder in Intellij Idea and run the main method in the file `src/com/exercise/analysis/main/App.java`
- The code was written in Java 11. It may work with Java 8 but it is recommended to run it with Java 11

## Assumption
- The default input data files are "data.txt" and "data_inverse.txt" in the root folder
- The results of the analysis are both printed out to standard output and written to the files "result.txt" and "result_inverse.txt" in the root folder 
- There is no requirement to sort the tokens in alphabet order 

## Notes
- The program can be modified to read the input data from different files or from the command line arguments
